            The Hindu community is the largest religious community in the city. Muslims form
            another prominent community in the city and there is a sizeable population of Jains
            as well. One finds people from different parts of the country, speaking different
            languages, celebrating different festivals all co-existing peacefully. Though Mysore
            has become a modern city it has not lost touch with its tradition and culture. The
            ultimate expression of cultural unity is witnessed during the 10 daylong Dasara
            festivities that is synonymous with Mysore. The celebration not only includes religious
            ceremonies but also the decoration of houses, display of dolls, distribution of
            sweets to neighbours and children. The residents of Mysore have celebrated Dasara
            in this manner for decades.

            The high point of the celebration in the olden days was the "Jamboo Savari" or the
            procession of the Maharaja on elephant back through the streets of Mysore. It is
            said that Dasara was celebrated in this manner from the times of the epics and was
            continued by all the Kings of Mysore. Even today Dasara is celebrated with the same
            pomp and splendor with some minor changes. Now the Royal Elephant carries the golden
            idol of Goddess Chamundhi in the splendid procession through the streets of Mysore.
            Though Mysore has become a modern city and has all the comforts of modern development,
            this city has managed to retain all its old world charm.
